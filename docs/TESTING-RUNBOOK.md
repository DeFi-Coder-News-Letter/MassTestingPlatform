The Testing Runbook walks you through the Drive Through Testing site logisitcs, broken down by the two main checkpoints.  The roles required for each checkpoint are provided, and a more comprehensive staffing plan can be found [here](./site-staffing-plan)

## Checkpoint 1 Roles: 

Role | Description
---- | ----------

Checkpoint 1 Radio | Communicates vehicle numbers to Checkpoint 2 and instructs vehicles on which lane to use 
Tent Radio | Acknowledges vehicle numbers and instructs Checkpoint 1 Radio on which lanes vehicles should use

## Checkpoint 1 Overview

1. Vehicle arrives at gate.  

1. Vehicle follows single line until splitting into lane 1 or 2 for Checkpoint 1 first stop. 

1. Verification asks vehicle for prescription(s) and ID for each patient to be tested and instructs vehicle to put them on the vehicle’s dashboard. 

1. Verification cross-checks patient’s name with appointment number for that day. 

1. Verification writes patient number on windshield and driver’s window with soap. 

    * If there are multiple patient prescriptions, multiple numbers should be written. (These do not have to be same scheduled time or related in any way.) 

   * If it’s a law enforcement referral, prescription does not have to be shown, only ID, and the patient number should be underlined on windshield and window. 

    * If the vehicle is unable to locate ID, prescription or has trouble understanding the situation, they can be asked to pull aside, so other vehicles can proceed. 

    * If there’s no appointment, verification explains that an appointment must be scheduled and puts a paper with scheduling information under the windshield wiper for the driver to retrieve once they are safely away from site personnel. 

1. Vehicle without any appointment proceeds to exit lane. 

    * Checkpoint 1 Radio alerts Tent Radio that a vehicle will be exiting. 

1. Vehicle with appointment(s) pulls forward to and stops at covered area for Checkpoint 1. 

1. Checkpoint 1 Radio calls to Tent Radio with vehicle and patient number(s) to pull paperwork. 

1. Tent Radio advises which lane to direct vehicle. Most often lane 1 or 3 because lane 2 is generally used for vehicles with multiple patients.

1. Runner signals vehicle to pull forward to covered area and holds there. 

1. Traffic Control signals Runner which station to go to. 

   * By default, vehicles go to furthest stations to start, thereafter according to availability. 

   * Larger vehicles may need to be balanced between stations to allow for space/flow. 

1. Runner escorts vehicle to designated station using the center lane for traffic. 

1. Runner signals vehicle to pull in parallel and close to station. (May need to correct and demonstrate more than once to get vehicle positioned correctly.)

### PLEASE NOTE RECOMMENDED HAND SIGNALS & FOLLOW SAFETY BEHAVIORS: 

* Windows stay up at all times until Medical Staff instructs the driver/passenger. 

* No cellphones are allowed or needed once entering Checkpoint 2. They can be used to display prescription only and no one should be taking photos or video. 

    * This is both for medical privacy and to prevent distractions. 

    * If you see a cellphone up, signal the person to put it away immediately. 

* Runners should use exaggerated gestures to clearly signal vehicles, because smaller rapid movements are harder to see and follow. 
    * Indicate which lane (1, 2 or 3) when stepping out. 

   * Signal forward with hand bending at the elbow, rather than quick flick of wrist or hand. 

    * Signal stop with closed fist – can also reinforce with palm if needed but watch for closed fist to signal stop or hold from the Traffic Controller. 

* DO NOT RUN! A steady walking pace is an appropriate speed for both people and vehicles. This also maintains a sense of calm in the area. 

* When walking, stay to the center of the traffic lane. 

  * Stay in front of the vehicle to keep yourself clearly in the driver’s sightline. 

  * When returning to queue, walk down the center line again. 

  * Give way to oncoming Runners with vehicles and departing vehicles by stepping fully to the side, out of traffic, in the empty space between the stations. 

  * Be on the lookout for distracted drivers pulling away from stations. Signal them to stop and give way to Runners and their escorted vehicles. 

* Guide vehicle to pull up parallel and as close as possible to station. This is very important to ensure the safety of the Medical Staff by keeping them out of the way of traffic. 

  * Use the station barrels as guides. The front bumper should be close to the upper barrel. 

  * Be especially mindful of the middle stations, where space is tight with through traffic. 

  * Runners should instruct drivers how to reposition vehicles if they pull up incorrectly. 

    * Please be patient with drivers, since they may not understand what they’re supposed to do and are likely stressed to begin with. 

    * For this reason, it’s safer for a Runner who does know what’s supposed to happen to assist before a driver wrongly assumes and causes an accident. 

* Drivers and Passengers should have masks on when they pull up to the station. 

  * If you notice patients or passengers without masks, signal to the Medical Staff to provide them one. 

  * Masks for public will be stocked at stations by Medical Supplies Runners. 

* Personal identification should be left on the dashboard or kept in-hand so it’s ready for Medical Staff to confirm before testing.
