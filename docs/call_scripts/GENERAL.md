*	How to make an appointment 
*	[address] Directions
*	About [location]

[Other questions] – Thank you for letting me know, [client]. You’re going to want to reach out to the Health Department in order to get that question answered. Do you have a pen and paper ready so I can get you that number? Great, the phone number is [health department phone]. Would you prefer for me to transfer you now or would you like to call on your own?

[Wants transfer] – OK, give me one moment while I transfer you over. As I connect you, just be aware there may be a long hold time. Thank you for calling the [location] drive-through testing call center. Take care.
