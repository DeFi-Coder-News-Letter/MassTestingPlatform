Hello, my name is [Agent Name] on a recorded line. I’ll be helping you with scheduling an appointment for a patient at the [location] drive-through testing location. Who do I have the pleasure of assisting today?

[Client gives name]

Pleasure to meet you, [client]. The first thing I want to verify is if you are a provider or if you are a prescribed individual? And are you a first responder, by chance?

[If provider] – Follow Provider Selection Script 

[If prescribed individual] – Follow Individual Script

Thank you. This line is specifically for providers to schedule appointments for their patients. Providers must have issued a prescription for the test in order to schedule an appointment. When issuing a prescription, providers must follow the Department of Health and Human Services guidance about collection and testing of specimens for COVID-19.

The first question I have for you is: Can you confirm that you are calling today to schedule an appointment on behalf of a patient?

[If no:] OK, you have two options to move forward. Either you can call back to book the appointment on behalf of the patient, or you will need to give the patient the physical prescription so that they can call us and book the appointment.

[If yes:] OK, before I collect all necessary information, I just need to verify that the patient resides in [supported area], correct?

[If no:] OK, we are only scheduling appointments for [supported area] currently. I can direct you to the Health Department for some possible testing locations for your patient. Would you like me to transfer you over now, or would you like their number to call on your own time? [Health Department phone]

[If yes:] Great, now let's get some information.

Thank you for that information. Just to make you aware, the test takes approximately 15 minutes to perform.

It looks like the next available opening is on [date] at [time]. May we schedule that for your patient?

[If yes, book appointment in scheduling system.]

[If no, find another date and time that works.]

OK, let me know when you have a pen and paper ready as I’m going to confirm the patient’s appointment time, date and location. Your patient’s test has been scheduled for [date] and [time] at [location] located at [location address].

Your patient can go to [website] for a map of the location and more information about the testing process.
