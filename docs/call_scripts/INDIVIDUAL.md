Hello, my name is [Agent Name] on a recorded line. I’ll be helping you with scheduling an appointment at the [location] drive-through testing location. Who do I have the pleasure of assisting today? 

[Client gives name] Pleasure to meet you, [client]. The first thing I want to verify is if you are a provider or if you are a prescribed individual? And are you a first responder, by chance?

[If provider] — Follow Provider Script 

[If prescribed individual] — Follow Individual Script

Thank you! Now to make sure we’re assisting you correctly, are you looking to schedule an appointment today or do you have general questions you are looking to be answered? 

[If scheduling appointment] — Follow Individual Script 

[If they have general questions] — Follow General Questions Script

Thank you. Now, just a few questions for you before I look into scheduling your appointment. Are you located in [supported area]? 

[If no:] OK, we are only scheduling appointments for the [supported area] currently. I can direct you to the Health Department for some possible testing locations and more information. Would you like me to transfer you over now, or would you like their number to call on your own time? [Health Department phone]

[If yes:] Do you have a prescription to be tested for COVID-19?

[If no:] OK, we will need you to have a prescription from a doctor to be tested for COVID-19. If you don’t have a doctor, you may also be able to get a prescription from a nearby urgent care facility. Once you have this, please call back so we can collect the information needed to schedule the test for you.

[If yes:] OK, the next thing I’m going to do is collect some basic information to get the appointment set up.

It looks like the next available opening is on [date] at [time]. Does that work for you?

[If yes, book appointment in scheduling system.] We can either send you an email confirmation or text confirmation for your appointment. Do you have a preference? [Make sure you check off the consent boxes.]

[If no, find another date and time that works.]

Great, let me know when you have a pen and paper ready, as I’m going to confirm your appointment date, time and location.
