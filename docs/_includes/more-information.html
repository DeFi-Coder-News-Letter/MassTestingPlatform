          Mass Testing Platform is a scheduling, logistics and data orchestration
          application that was designed in collaboration between Rocket Mortgage,
          Rock Connections, and the City of Detroit to facilitate drive-through
          testing during the COVID-19 pandemic.
        </p>
        <p class="section__copy">
          The documentation on this site will give you a high-level overview
          of the drive-through testing process, from end-to-end. Please note,
          this process was designed around the regulations in effect in
          Detroit, Michigan, during the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, you
          may need to make adjustments to the process and technology to
          meet the current regulations in your area.
