The Covid Community Care Network has approved your request for testing appointment times for your employees. Your business has been approved for $slots_approved testing appointments.  A City of Detroit Business Liaison will be contacting you shortly to walk you through these next steps.

Scheduling

Each employee must call $phone to schedule their own appointment. We have issued your business a scheduling code for your employees to use when calling in to schedule an appointment.

Your code is: $business_code

Your employees must have this code ready and available when they call to schedule their appointment.  If they do not have that number, we will not be able to schedule the appointment for them.

Day of Appointment

Tests are conducted at the Joe Dumars Fieldhouse at the Michigan State Fairgrounds at the corner of Woodward Ave. and E. State Fair Ave.  Employees should enter the drive through at the entrance on E. State Fair Ave across from Baumann Ave.

Employees will be required to present a valid form of ID upon arrival at the testing location in order to receive a test. They must arrive in and remain in their vehicles while at the testing site. Pets are not allowed at the drive-thru testing site.

You and your employees can go to www.detroitmi.gov/testing for a map of the location and more information about the testing process.

The test takes approximately 15 minutes to perform.
